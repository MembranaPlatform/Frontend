If he do â€“ all of 3,000,000 goes to the General pool. Also, he loses his reward for the current week and other investors from Early pool share it. The remaining 450,000 MBN he has commited to the General pool. He can sell rewards or full stake amount from this pool.</div>

She gains rewards from the Early pool and from the General pool at the same time. She can sell rewards paid out from the General pool.
